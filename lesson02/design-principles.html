            Google's website is a good example of Fitt's law, because of how they present their information. They know that the things their customers want to see is the search bar and their trending searches. It is large and apparent. You also have the sign in button right at the top. All of this is used to make a better user experience.

          <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/?lang=eng"> The Church of Jesus Christ</a>

        </div>
        <p class="second-paragraph">
            The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints website is a great example of placement and proximity. Right away when you open the page on a mobile device the first and biggest thing you can select is the rotating menu with all of the most recent and used options. The other selections you have are also going to be the ones you want to use most too. The sign in button and of course the hamburger menu to select your next screen.

        <h2>PARC: Alignment</h2>
        <h3>
          <a href="https://www.lttstore.com/">
            LTT Store

        <div class="ltt-photo">
            <img

        </div>
        <p class="third-paragraph">
            The LTT store is a great place to see Alignment. In both the desktop and the mobile version you can tell the emphasis on symetry and ease of use. It even has an eye grabbing selection right now. Another great example of this is with the LTT store logo. Even with it being a little bigger than the other icons it is still in the centered both vertically and horizantally.
